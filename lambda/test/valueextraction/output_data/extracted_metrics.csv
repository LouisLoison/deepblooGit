Project Background 
 
UnhcrS Compounds, Premises, And Offices Generate Greenhouse Gas Emissions Amounting To An Estimated 97,136 Tons Of Co2 Annually. One Major Source Of Emissions Is Linked To The Fact That Unhcr Runs Diesel Generators, Particularly In Large Field Compounds In Deep Field Africa Operations. Converting These Compounds To Solar Energy Could Have Both A Positive Carbon Impact And A Positive Financial Impact, Since Solar Energy Is Expected To Be Cheaper Than Existing Diesel/Fossil Fuel Generation. 
 
Over The Course Of 2020, With Support From The Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida), Unhcr Has Designed And Operationalized The Internal Governance And Technical Procedures For Operating A Green Fund To Enable Solarization Of Its Deep Field Compounds. In Close Collaboration With The German Cooperation (Giz), Unhcr Has Also Conducted Feasibility Analysis On A First Set Of Potential Sites And Has Commenced Legal And Technical Work To Prepare For A First Round Of Competitive Procurement Of Electricity From Private Sector Solar Energy Developers.
