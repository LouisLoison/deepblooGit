Project Background 
 
UnhcrS Compounds, Premises, And Offices Generate Greenhouse Gas Emissions Amounting To An Estimated 97,136 Tons Of Co2 Annually. One Major Source Of Emissions Is Linked To The Fact That Unhcr Runs Diesel Generators, Particularly In Large Field Compounds In Deep Field Africa Operations. Converting These Compounds To Solar Energy Could Have Both A Positive Carbon Impact And A Positive Financial Impact, Since Solar Energy Is Expected To Be Cheaper Than Existing Diesel/Fossil Fuel Generation. 
 
Over The Course Of 2020, With Support From The Swedish International Development Cooperation (Sida), Unhcr Has Designed And Operationalized The Internal Governance And Technical Procedures For Operating A Green Fund To Enable Solarization Of Its Deep Field Compounds. In Close Collaboration With The German Cooperation (Giz), Unhcr Has Also Conducted Feasibility Analysis On A First Set Of Potential Sites And Has Commenced Legal And Technical Work To Prepare For A First Round Of Competitive Procurement Of Electricity From Private Sector Solar Energy Developers.

Objectives of technical assistance: 
- Develop online training content on the care of PLHIV 
- Transform theoretical modules into online training module, ready to be used 
to strengthen the skills of future intermediary and referent physicians including 
assessment tools, and focused on the practice of providing real-life care for PLHIV.
 Assistance technique pour l’élaboration d’un module de formation 
 en ligne sur la prise en charge de l’infection par le VIH 
 Termes de référence du prestataire de service 
 Contexte et justification : 
 Au Maroc, la stratégie nationale de lutte contre le sida se réfère aux objectifs de 
 développement durable (ODD) et s’aligne sur la vision et les orientations de l’ONUSIDA et de 
 l’OMS, afin d’accélérer la riposte au VIH et atteindre l’élimination du sida en 2030. 
 Ainsi, le Plan Stratégique National d’extension pour la lutte contre le sida 2023 épouse les 
 objectifs de l’initiative « Accélérer la riposte » de l’ONUSIDA, à savoir 90% des Personnes 
 vivant avec le VIH qui connaissent leur statut, 90% parmi elles qui accèdent au traitement 
 ARV, et 90% parmi ces dernières qui arrivent à la suppression de la charge virale. L’un des 
 engagements prioritaires du PSN est également d’atteindre l’élimination de la transmission 
 du VIH de la mère à l’enfant d’ici 2023. 
 En prévision de l’augmentation de la couverture des PVVIH par les ARV, le Ministère de la Santé 
 a élaboré un plan d’extension de la filière des soins VIH, impliquant la création progressive 
 de nouveaux centres référents ou centres relais de prise en charge de l’infection par le VIH, 
 avec comme objectif de passer de 19 centres référents à 38 centres référents et relais, à 
 l’horizon de 2023. 
 Objectifs de l’assistance technique : 
  Elaborer le contenu de formation en ligne sur la prise en charge des PVVIH 
  Transformer les modules théoriques en module de formation en ligne, prêt à être utilisé 
 pour le renforcement des compétences des futurs médecins relais et référents incluant 
 les outils d’évaluation, et axé sur la pratique de la prise en charge des PVVIH en vie réelle.

 Technical assistance for the development of a training module 
 online on the management of HIV infection 
 Terms of reference of the service provider 
 Context and rationale: 
 In Morocco, the national AIDS control strategy refers to the objectives of 
 sustainable development (SDGs) and aligns with the vision and guidance of UNAIDS and 
 WHO, to accelerate the response to HIV and achieve the elimination of AIDS by 2030. 
 Thus, the National Strategic Extension Plan for the fight against AIDS 2023 embraces the 
 targets of the UNAIDS Fast Track Initiative of 90% of people 
 living with HIV who know their status, 90% of them accessing treatment 
 ARVs, and 90% of these achieve viral load suppression. One of the 
 Priority commitments of the NHP is also to achieve the elimination of transmission 
 of mother-to-child HIV by 2023. 
 In anticipation of increasing coverage of PLWHIV with ARVs, the Ministry of Health 
 has developed a plan to expand the HIV care sector, involving the gradual creation 
 new referral centers or relay centers for the care of HIV infectio"
