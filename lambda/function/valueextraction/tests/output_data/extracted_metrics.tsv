C00682 Evenes — Energisentral [Energy Central], Purchase of Energy
2018/3312
Forsvarsbygg [the Norwegian Defence Estates Agency] aims to procure environmentally friendly energy and invites interested parties to a collaboration for the delivery of thermal energy to buildings connected with Evenes Flystasjon [Evenes Air Base]. Establishment and operation of the Energy Central for 20 years, for the sale of thermal energy in the form of circulating hot and cold water — based on renewable resources. The Norwegian Defence Estates Agency wants an option for a further 10 years operation. Dimensioning effect:
Alternative I: 4.0 MW heating and 1.0 MW cooling
Alternative II: 5.0 MW heating and 1.2 MW cooling (incl. Avinor)
A 1.0 MW electric boiler will also be delivered.
Tenderers are encouraged to suggest alternative technical solutions: Up to 2 alternatives per tenderer will be assessed as separate offers, based on documented combined benefits in regard to environment, operational reliability and energy prices.
The total delivery must include planning, investment, engineering design, construction and operation of a complete energy system for delivery of thermal energy. The Norwegian Defence Estates Agency has a site for disposition.
13200000.00
The contracting authority is planning to implement a dialogue through negotiations with one or several tenderers who have submitted qualified tenders to the competition. The selection will be undertaken after an evaluation of the award criteria. The dialogue can be limited to dealing with clarifications/corrections, but is also intended to deal with the pages of the offers that are relevant to how the offer scores against the award criteria.
If, after receiving the offers, the contracting authority considers that it is most appropriate to award a contract without conducting a dialogue in the form of real negotiations, the contracting authority will retain this possibility. NB: that none of the tenderers can expect dialogue about their offer.
Reliable operation, backup and environmental footprints
15 %
Technical solution and the tenderer's competence and implementation plan.
15 %
70 %
Potential extension of the contract beyond 20 years of energy supply.
